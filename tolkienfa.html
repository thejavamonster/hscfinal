	<p>In (most of) the First Age of Arda, the world was a flat disk and the Two Trees provided light to Valinor. 
	Arda was surrounded by a spinning sphere of stars, which were created by Varda in the Years of the Lamps. 
	The world was surrounded by Ekkaia, the Encircling Seas, outside of which was the Void.
	The Two Trees, Telperion and Laurelin, were located in Valmar in Valinor, which at that point in time was still a physical place on the earth. 
	They provided light to Valinor but not Middle-earth, as the Pelori Mountains running up and down the east side of Valinor blocked their light from traveling across the Great Sea.
	Valinor and Middle-earth were joined at the north edge of the world by the Helcaraxe, or the Grinding Ice.
	Beleriand, the area of Middle-earth west of the Blue Mountains, still existed for most of the First Age, although it sunk in the War of Wrath.	<p>
