	<p>In the Second Age of Arda, the world was still flat, although the Two Trees had been destroyed by Melkor and Ungoliant.
	In place of them, there were the Sun and the Moon, which were created from the last fruit of Laurelin and the last flower of Telperion, respectively.
	The Sun was carried by the Maia Arien, and the Moon by Tilion, a Maia of Orome.
	They provided light to both Middle-earth and Valinor.
	At the first sunrise near the end of the First Age, Men, the Younger Children of Illuvatar, awoke, and many of them traveled west to Beleriand to help the Eldar in the War of Wrath.
	In the beginning of the Second Age, the Valar gave the Edain (the humans who helped in the War of Wrath) an island to live in between the Middle-earth and Valinor.
	This island was called Numenor.
	In the East of the world, the geography was mostly the same as in the First Age, although much of the Inland Sea of Helcar had dried up.
